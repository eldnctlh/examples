        <div class="print-desc-text">I-75 is a perfect sample of America. It starts right at the Canadian border in Sault Ste. Marie, then winding down to Detroit, and into the heart of the Midwest down through Pure Michigan, and Ohio. From there, it makes its way through Kentucky and Tennessee, stopping near and in cities like Lexington, Knoxville, and Chattanooga, before entering Georgia. I-75 is a main route to Atlanta, and from Atlanta, it continues into Florida. As you cruise the route past Tampa, take some time to enjoy the brief East-West stretch through the Everglades that's known as Alligator Alley before ending just north of Miami. Whether you're looking for the fastest route from the Midwest to Florida, or you happen to be enjoying the ride between some of America's coolest cities, I-75 is loaded with plenty to see and do along the way.</div>

A few beautiful vineyards in the surrounding area to tour include Harmony Cellars, L'Aventure Winery, Wild Horse Winery, and Halter Ranch Vineyard.<br><br>The best time of year to visit: Big Sur is actually beautiful to visit all year-round. However, the high season for tourists is generally April through October. This is when the weather is at its best. Most facilities are open during this time and the weather is gorgeous for beach walking and trail hiking. There are rain showers that can come on quite abruptly, but then they dissipate into a pretty mist. Off peak season is November through March. There's not as much fog during this time, which makes driving easier. Less visitors makes lodging much more affordable, however some businesses are closed in off-season or have shorter off-season hours. If you're looking to visit purely for the scenic vistas, then December is one of the clearest months for photographing the region.</div>
